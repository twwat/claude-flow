**Production-ready multi-agent AI orchestration for Claude Code**

*Deploy 54+ specialized agents in coordinated swarms with self-learning capabilities, fault-tolerant consensus, and enterprise-grade security.*

</div>

## Overview

Claude-Flow is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework that transforms Claude Code into a powerful multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

### Claude Code: With vs Without Claude-Flow

| Capability | Claude Code Alone | Claude Code + Claude-Flow |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Agent Collaboration** | Agents work in isolation, no shared context | Agents collaborate via swarms with shared memory and consensus |
| **Coordination** | Manual orchestration between tasks | Queen-led hierarchy with 5 consensus algorithms (Raft, Byzantine, Gossip) |
| **Memory** | Session-only, no persistence | HNSW vector memory with 150x-12,500x faster retrieval |
| **Learning** | Static behavior, no adaptation | SONA self-learning with <0.05ms adaptation, improves over time |
| **Task Routing** | You decide which agent to use | Intelligent routing based on learned patterns (89% accuracy) |
| **Complex Tasks** | Manual breakdown required | Automatic decomposition across 5 domains (Security, Core, Integration, Support) |
| **Background Workers** | Nothing runs automatically | 12 context-triggered workers auto-dispatch on file changes, patterns, sessions |
| **LLM Provider** | Anthropic only | 6 providers with automatic failover and cost-based routing (85% savings) |
| **Security** | Standard protections | CVE-hardened with bcrypt, input validation, path traversal prevention |
| **Performance** | Baseline | 2.8-4.4x faster tasks, 4-32x memory reduction via quantization |

### Key Capabilities

- **54+ Specialized Agents** - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps tasks. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

- **Coordinated Agent Teams** - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents can spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using patterns like hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer).

- **Learns From Your Workflow** - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

- **Works With Any LLM** - Switch between Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

- **Plugs Into Claude Code** - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use claude-flow commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

- **Production-Ready Security** - Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities: input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

### Why Claude-Flow v3?

Claude-Flow v3 introduces **self-learning neural capabilities** that no other agent orchestration framework offers. While competitors require manual agent configuration and static routing, Claude-Flow learns from every task execution, prevents catastrophic forgetting of successful patterns, and intelligently routes work to specialized experts.

| **MCP Integration** | Native | - | - | - | - |
| **Swarm Topologies** | 4 (mesh, hierarchical, etc.) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Key differentiators:**
- **SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture)** - Learns optimal agent routing from trajectory outcomes with <0.05ms adaptation
- **EWC++ (Elastic Weight Consolidation)** - Prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new patterns
- **MoE (Mixture of Experts)** - 8 specialized experts with dynamic gating network for intelligent task routing
- **Flash Attention** - 2.49x-7.47x speedup for attention computations
- **Hyperbolic Embeddings** - Poincaré ball model for hierarchical data representation (better for code structure)
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** - 128x memory compression for efficient fine-tuning
- **Int8 Quantization** - 3.92x memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss
- **Claims System** - Human-agent work ownership with handoff protocols
- **Byzantine Consensus** - Fault-tolerant coordination even with malicious agents

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart MCP server
npx claude-flow@v3alpha mcp start
```

**Agent spawn failures**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -m
# Reduce max agents if memory constrained
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MAX_AGENTS=5
```

**Pattern search returning no results**
```bash
# Verify patterns are stored
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
# Re-run pretraining if empty
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain
```

**Windows path issues**
```powershell
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "./data"
# Or use absolute path
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "C:/Users/name/claude-flow/data"
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
# Or use nvm to manage Node.js
```

**High memory usage**
```bash
# Enable garbage collection
node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/claude-flow
# Reduce HNSW parameters for lower memory
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_M=8
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_EF=100
```

## Migration Guide (V2 → V3)

### Breaking Changes

1. **Module Structure**: V3 uses scoped packages (`@claude-flow/*`)
2. **Memory Backend**: Default changed from JSON to AgentDB with HNSW
3. **Hooks System**: New ReasoningBank replaces basic pattern storage
4. **Security**: Stricter input validation enabled by default

### Upgrade Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup existing data
cp -r ./data ./data-backup-v2

# 2. Update to V3
npm install claude-flow@latest

# 3. Run migration
npx claude-flow@v3alpha migrate --from v2

# 4. Verify installation
npx claude-flow@v3alpha --version
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
```

### Configuration Changes

```bash
# V2 (deprecated)
npx claude-flow init --mode basic

# V3 (new)
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain  # Bootstrap learning
```

### API Changes

| V2 API | V3 API |
|--------|--------|
| `claude-flow start` | `claude-flow mcp start` |
| `--pattern-store` | `--memory-backend agentdb` |
| `hooks record` | `hooks post-edit --success` |
| `swarm create` | `swarm init --topology` |
